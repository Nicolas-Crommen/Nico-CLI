Holidates allows you to retrieve the holidays for any given country or year.

Simply type "holidates + country + year" in the terminal and you'll get the list. Enjoy !

If you don't specify a year, you'll get the current year holidays.

To install it : npm install @nicolas1576/holidates

Thank you !
